# NAME

MooX::ProtectedAttributes - Create attribute only usable inside your package

# VERSION

version 0.02

# SYNOPSIS

You can use it in a role (Moo, Moose, Mo with a trick)

    package myRole;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::ProtectedAttributes;

    protected_has 'foo' => (is => 'ro');

    sub display_foo { print shift->foo, "\n" }

    1;

Or also directly in you class

    package myApp;
    use Moo;
    use MooX::ProtectedAttributes;

    protected_has 'bar' => (is => 'ro');

    sub display_bar { print shift->bar, "\n" }

    1;

Then

    myApp->bar("123");
    myApp->bar         # croak
    myApp->display_bar # 123

# DESCRIPTION

It happend that you may want to create a class with private attributes that can't be used outside this package.

For example, you want to create in lazy, a DB connection, but you want to handle it in your class in a specific way (with possible handle of errors ....).
You really want, even with the "\_" before your attribute (which mean private), to avoid access of this attribute by any other packages.

The goal of this package is to allow the init of the private attribute, but forbid reading from outside the package.

With a protected attribute named "foo" for example, you can't do this outside the current package :

    my $foo = $myObj->foo;

or

    $myObj->foo->stuff();

But this method is allowed inside the package where it has been declared.

# METHODS

## import

The method provide 2 methods :

- protected\_has

    Like a "has", disable read access outside the current class.

- protected\_with\_deprecated\_has

    Instead of dying, it will display a DEPRECATED message and run as usual.
    This allow you to alert user of the protected method to fix their program before you forbid the access to the attribute.

- unless attribute option

    You can use the "unless" => sub { $condition } option to your attribute.

    If the condition match, the attribute will not generate any warnings or die

        protect_has "foo" => (is => 'ro'), unless => sub { $ENV{SKIP_WARNING} };

        $myObj->foo # croak
        

        {
    	local $ENV{SKIP_WARNING} = 1;
          $myObj->foo # works
        }

    You can use it for your test, or may be to match some condition like 'OK if it is call from this package'
